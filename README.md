Mflix is a movie search application built on React that lets users search for their favorite movies. The user can enter a movie title into a search bar and the application will use Axios to fetch data from the API(www.omdbapi.com) and display the results on the user interface.

Some features include:

The application includes a feature that automatically focuses on the search input field whenever the user opens the application. This saves the user time and effort by eliminating the need to manually click on the search bar before entering their query.


Input validation to ensure that the user enters a movie title before initiating the search. If the user attempts to search without entering any text, the application will display an alert prompting them to enter a movie title.

In addition to input validation, the application also includes a feature that returns the user to the default home screen if the search query is empty. This is to ensure that the user is always presented with a clear starting point for their searches, rather than being stuck on a blank screen if they accidentally initiate a search without entering any text.

Automatically adds a default poster image if the movie poster is not available in the API. This ensures that the user is always presented with a clear and consistent visual representation of the movies in their search results, even if the poster is not available in the API.

If the search query returns no results, the application will display a fallback UI that informs the user that no results were found. The fallback UI may include some helpful tips on how to improve the search criteria.

The application is also designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices, so that users can access it on any device, from desktop computers to mobile phones.

The application is designed to avoid any page reloads or refreshes during use. This ensures that the user experience is seamless and uninterrupted, allowing users to easily browse through search results and navigate the application without any interruptions.![Screenshot (472)](https://github.com/ThotaRitikesh/Mflix./assets/91207994/d6db1d2b-3ac1-4d97-b2bd-2c43a4e4414e)


Makes only the required API calls to fetch data for the user's search query. This ensures that the application is efficient and performs well, even when dealing with large datasets or slow network connections.
